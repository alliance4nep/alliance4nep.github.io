        <h3>Our Initiatives</h3>
        <h4>Vaccine advocacy and lobbying </h4>
        <p>By pushing actors with the power to (re)allocate their surplus
            vaccine doses, and to work towards making sure vulnerable communities in Nepal receive this intervention.
            For more information see <a href="http://www.vaccinesfornepal.org/">www.vaccinesfornepal.org</a>, which
            includes our recent letter to the US Ambassador to Nepal. Our Nepal-based petition received tremendous
            support, with over 20,000 signatures in two days, and 25k when we closed it out. You can find the petition
            to US Representatives and decision-makers <a href="http://chng.it/kn848ygmT8">here</a>. We are
            simultaneously expanding our advocacy to other countries.</p>
        <h4>Strategic support for isolation centers</h4>
        <p>We recently created a "Blueprint",
            integrating&nbsp; the Nepal government's outline, and in collaboration with medical doctors who have
            been treating COVID patients in Nepal and abroad. We&#39;ve shared and will continue to share this with
            individuals and groups setting up surge management/isolation centers across Nepal. You can find our initial
            draft of the blueprint <a href="https://tinyurl.com/SurgeManagementCenterBlueprint">here</a>.
            We also created a template to self-monitor during <a href="https://tinyurl.com/TrackCovidSymptoms">home
                isolation</a>. This is
            information on home isolation in <a href="https://tinyurl.com/HomeIsolationNepali">Nepali</a>. We&rsquo;ve
            been working with local government representatives to understand what they require to set up and run these
            centers, and creating a platform for the private sector to step up and help.</p>
        <p>
            COVID Alliance member HAPSA-Nepal has also created a database of medical officers and nurses to assist with
            staffing of these isolation centers in collaboration with the local government. Nurses can sign up <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbKXet7CytiCHMBLF8sLkmcCgTcYdQBbVw8P8r44Jqmr9mQQ/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1&amp;flr=0&amp;fbclid=IwAR3SL-WjhC3JyME0W6OUXM6Crnrx2ahBbvhdFbIMFaKOaaqzZL-W4yK9Pgk">here</a>.
            Medical officers can sign up <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vLfSohsOrZrCvFYaDsUDTSriMWlvQBaOQSQJv60BWGE/edit?usp=drivesdk&amp;fbclid=IwAR3z_qRW5qC2-r_uXaptCNm9PtmPBuw7pbYO7PRlRSghb5o-1LZRJXwM2fk">here</a>.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Our team has also been working to identify potential isolation centers and set it up with required resources
            with food, telemedicine support, staff training, and oxygen supplies for those that need it. We have been
            advocating with local wards and mayors within our sphere of reach to open isolation centers for their wards.
            Currently, Alliance member, the Nawa Asha Griha Clinic, is supporting isolation centers by providing
            medicines, food, ambulance service and oxygen cylinders run by the local ward officers. Isolation centers
            set up in collaboration with the local governments are in Tokha Ward&nbsp; 2, Budhanilkantha - Golfutar Ward
            No. 2, and we are scouting for two more centers.</p>

        <p>You can donate to the Nawa Asha Griha Clinic <a href="https://www.nagnepal.com/en/donate/">here</a>. A list
            of isolation centers if you are looking for those with oxygen, <a
                    href="https://tinyurl.com/NPLIsolationCentreList">is here</a>.
            <strong>Please call before going</strong>. Please also note that this list is a work in progress.
        </p>

        <h4>A hotline (988-003-5000) </h4>
        <p>Responding to patient and caregiver calls looking for medical
            support staffed by trained nurses and medical officers has been up and running for several days already,
            this also includes a telemedicine referral. We have been receiving well over 100 calls/day. Given the
            volume, we have trained and recruited additional medical members, and added hours of operation to cover the
            call distribution times. Please refer to this <a
                    href="https://alliance4nep.page.link/hotline-dashboard">dashboard</a> for stats. Given the volume,
            we have trained and recruited
            additional medical members, and added hours of operation to cover the call distribution times. While we are
            glad we were able to respond, it is painful to know the reasons why.</p>

        <p>We receive calls from all over the country and even from abroad seeking information about home care,
            medication, symptoms, risks and other COVID related queries. We were also able to onboard a Pediatric
            Consultant for teleconsultation to address many queries related to child health. We also frequently receive
            calls for ICU beds, which we forward to <a href="http://www.covidconnectnp.org">www.covidconnectnp.org</a>,
            and for
            oxygen supply, to Alliance initiative OxygenforNepal, among others. Furthermore, we keep track of calls that
            we believe need economic assistance and follow up with the caller. If they need it, we can connect them to
            the Alliance members working on food relief or guide them to the nearest distribution center that we know
            of. ASK Foundation and Danphe Care are leading this effort. To support this initiative please go <a
                    href="http://www.askfoundation.org/">here</a>.</p>
        <h4>Public Information Campaign</h4>
        <p>Alliance members have scripted and disseminated Public Service
            Announcements (PSAs) through community radio stations in local languages. Alliance member Rising Production
            House Pvt. Ltd has put together relevant information for dissemination, which has been playing&nbsp; for a
            few days already. Currently 23 local FM across the nation broadcast 5 different PSA in Nepali and Maithili
            language. The information will be on air for a month. All of this information is for consumption and for
            local organizations. They are publicly available<a href="http://tinyurl.com/CovidAudioPSANepal"> in this
                folder</a>.</p>

        <p>We have designed 5 PSA in different local languages (Maithili, Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Doteli, Tamang). These are
            for social media.</p>
        <h4>Oxygen support, cylinder tracking and circulation/transport support</h4>
        <p> As of May 8th, 6
            hospitals in Kathmandu have issued press releases regarding problems with oxygen procurement. While we work
            to understand and get to the core of the problem - is it a problem at the oxygen plant level, or refilling
            infrastructure or distribution system - we continue to find oxygen cylinders for hospitals and patients who
            need them through the OxygenForNepal initiative led by Creasion, an Alliance member. So far, we have been
            able to support 15 oxygen cylinders and multiple oxygen refills for those who can&rsquo;t afford, and are
            working across continents, our procurement channels, and institutional fundraising networks to potentially
            procure 2,000 cylinders from China to bolster the distribution system. You can find our more <a
                    href="https://creasion.org/oxygen-for-nepal">OxygenForNepal</a>.</p>
        <h4>COVID-19 Key Concept Trainings</h4>
        <p>On May 13th, we partnered with HAPSA-Nepal and Brown
            University &amp; Project Hope to conduct a training of trainers course on clinical management of COVID-19
            with updated evidence-based clinical guidelines. The training includes videos, simulations, and case
            scenarios. Furthermore, our Alliance partners have been training hotline medical staff and isolation center
            staff on COVID-19 treatment algorithms, which were prepared and delivered focusing on Nepal.</p>
        <h4>Support and Food Assistance</h4>
        <p> We're establishing a means by which daily wage laborers,
            members of marginalized communities, and people who may be having other medical emergencies, can access
            support. We are still doing outreach for this. We have a proposal for the banking and financial sector to
            set up a crisis welfare fund as a part of their CSR&nbsp; to support frontline workers at isolation
            centers&nbsp; in the event that they get sick and need monetary and medical support for Covid-related
            medical expenses. At present, our suggestion is to have this fund active for up to 4 months, with up to 1
            lakh available on a reimbursement basis. The concept note for the welfare fund is <a
                    href="http://tinyurl.com/FrontlineWorkerWelfareFundNpl">here</a>.</p>
        <h4>Mental Wellbeing</h4>
        <p> Given the current situation is causing a lot of stress, anxiety, and other
            issues related to the mind, we are
            organizing various online sessions to help people manage their emotional and mental wellbeing. We are
            working with mental health organizations to create support group networks and access to relevant and
            qualified
            resources.</p>
