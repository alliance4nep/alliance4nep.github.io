    <h3>What is Covid Alliance For Nepal?</h3>
    <p>Covid Alliance For Nepal is a group of individuals and organizations who have come together to help the country
        respond to the second wave of COVID-19 from local to national level. This group is a collaborative initiative
        open to any individual or organization willing to contribute to this relief effort. To efficiently manage the
        efforts, we have created groups within the Alliance to tackle different aspects of the relief work. Currently,
        we are working to tackle the Covid crisis especially in the areas of minimizing spread, reducing the number of
        patients being hospitalized, supporting treatment, and providing crisis economic support.</p>
    <h3>What are we doing?</h3>
    <p>We are currently working on three major projects where we saw the most imminent need and gaps.</p>
    <h4 class="mb-3">Telemedicine Hotline</h4>
    <p>We have trained medical teams that have been supporting the Nepali people by providing general information
        regarding COVID-19 as well as appropriate telemedicine guidance and directing them to the proper resources to
        help manage/treat COVID 19. The medical team will provide consultation to manage COVID-19 positive cases at home
        when possible, and identify the urgency for hospitalization to reduce the load of unnecessary
        hospitalization.</p>
    <h4 class="mb-3">Oxygen for Nepal</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Given the scarcity of oxygen gas cylinders in Nepal, we are coordinating efforts to procure 500 oxygen
            cylinders within the month of May.
        </li>
        <li>We are setting up efficient tracking and distribution channels, where transport and oxygen refill and
            circulation times are managed to maximize the use of each oxygen cylinder.
        </li>
        <li>We are seeking well-maintained oxygen cylinder donations from neighboring countries to reduce the cost of
            procurement.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="mb-3">Isolation Center</h4>
    <p>Our team has also been working to identify potential isolation centers and set them up with the required
        resources for it. Currently, we are supporting an isolation center with food and oxygen cylinders at Tokha that
        has been set up in collaboration with the local government. Our work regarding isolation centers is divided into
        the following aspects.</p>
    <h4 class="mb-3">Working with the government</h4>
    <p>We've been working with local government representatives to understand what they require to set up and run
        isolation centers and create a platform for private sectors to help with what is required for that matter.</p>
    <h4 class="mb-3">Welfare Fund</h4>
    <p>We are working with key banking professionals to create a welfare fund that will cover any Covid related medical
        expenses for the frontline workers of the isolation center for the duration of 4 months (while they are working)
        of up to 1 lakh per person.</p>
    <p>Alongside this we are actively campaigning on two following issues:</p>
    <h4 class="mb-3">Vaccines for Nepal</h4>
    <p>-</p>
    <h4 class="mb-3">Mental Wellbeing:</h4>
    <p>Given the current situation is causing a lot of stress, anxiety, and other issues related to the mind, we are
        organizing various online sessions to help people manage their emotional and mental wellbeing. We are working
        with mental health organizations to create support group networks and access to relevant and qualified
        resources.</p>
    <h4 class="mb-3">How can you help?</h4>
